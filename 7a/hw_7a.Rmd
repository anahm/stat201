### Homework 7a
*Ali Nahm and Alex Mao*

### Preliminaries
We are interested in analyzing data about individual basketball player box score statistics. First, we will load in the proper libraries and data. 

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv('dating_data.csv', header=T)
```


1. Make some static plots and write a plan of what you want to do in the dynamic graph. Put this together as a short (approximately three-page) document. We will discuss in class, then next time you will have to make the dynamic version.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
